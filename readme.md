# NetCoreAdmin

This package adds the abillity to use Spring Boot Admin with a Asp.Net Core Server.

## Usage

1. Install Package
1. Add in ConfigureServices:

```C#
services.AddNetCoreAdmin(Configuration);
```

1. Run Spring Boot Admin, e.g. in a Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 1111:1111 -e SPRING_BOOT_ADMIN_TITLE='SB Admin' -e SPRING_BOOT_ADMIN_SECURITY_ENABLED=false --name spring-boot-admin slydeveloper/spring-boot-admin:latest
```

1. Configure your application so that in can talk to SBA:

Configure in appsettings.json OR Code

```json
 "NetCoreAdmin": {
    "springBootServerUrl": "http://localhost:1111/instances",
    "retryTimeout": "0:00:10",
    "Application": {
      "BaseUrl": "http://host.docker.internal:5000"
    }
  }
```

Note that host.docker.internal is required on Windows hosts, otherwise it should be localhost:1111

1. Launch your application
1. Navigate to SBA, you should be able to see your server

## Issues

Note that a lot of endpoints are exposed at /actuator/* - always secure them otherwise sensitive data WILL leak!.

## Implemented Endpoints

### Health

Per default, we respond with an "OK" Health result.
You can customize this using [Health Checks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-3.1)

Please note that we use an internal Health check url, not the one configured by HealthCheck due to the need to conforms to Actuators Data format.

### Beans

This maps to the Services registered via ASP.NET Cores DI.
The displayed NAME is the concrete type, e.g. a DataProvider
The Alias contains the Type we registered for, e.g. IDataProvider.

In case of Lists of objects, a " | 1" is appended, since Actuator does not know of this concept.
The Type might not be accurate, especially for Factories.
Due to the DI limitations, it is not possible to show Dependencies.

### LogFile

Allows you to view the log of your app.
Due to the limitations of Spring Boot Admins existing contract, it is needed to write an actual file with the log file somewhere.
The location of this file can be set through the configuration

```json
"logFilePath": "C:\\dev\\nactuator\\NactuatorSample\\NactuatorSample\\log20200204.txt"
```

OR implement a `ILogFileLocationResolver` and register it in the DI.
The latter is usually more appropiate for Serilog, because Serilogs FileSink regularly changes the name of the file. See this Sample for an Implementation.

### Mappings / Routes

This returns a list of all registered routes.
Headers and Params are currently not supported
The infrastructure relies heavily on the same Attributes Swashbuckle uses (e.g. Consumes/Produces and Header).
In the future, we could probably leverage Swashbuckle itself, e.g. to get the headers, params and returns.

### ThreadDump

This returns the ThreadDump of the running process.
HERE BE DRAGONS!
.Net does not have the capabillity of Java to get the running processes at Runtime. I am using Debugging Interfaces to obtain this info, but this can crash / introduce weird bugs etc.
Therefore, you need to allow the ThreadDump explicity - ideally only on DEV/INT never on Production.

```json
"enableThreadDump": true
```

## Todo

1. Add more endpoints

    - Loggers
    - Info
    - Components( and move them off Environment?)
    - Metrics
    - Audit Log?
    - Caches?
1. Doku
1. Auth
1. Deregister
1. Get Config Validation working
1. Single-Property and EDIT for Env
1. Swashbuckle for Mappings
1. Move Threaddump to extra package


VOR RELEASE:
Flexible Implementation, sodass wir default Provider reingeben, aber diese ggf. ersetzen k√∂nnen.
